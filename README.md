If you'd like to see some of [Monsoon Commerce's](https://www.monsooncommerce.com/) Open Source projects we've released in Go, check out:

1. https://github.com/monsooncommerce/mockstomp We use it to mock a connection to a STOMP-compatable message broker for unit testing purposes

2. https://github.com/monsooncommerce/log A logging library (yes, another one) that allows for networked-logging to a STOMP-compatable message broker

3. https://github.com/monsooncommerce/stompWriter A short and simple Writer implementation we use with the logging library to write to STOMP-compatable message brokers

4. https://github.com/monsooncommerce/mockwriter A way to mock-up a writer for the logger when unit testing.

5. https://github.com/monsooncommerce/cryptoutil A simple wrapper to simplify some of Go's built-in cryptographic features (right now it only supports AES encrypt/decrypt). It has been pointed out to me that https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox is the more canonical solution, but feel free to use this, too.

**The defer statement**: A reserved word in Go that causes a function to execute as the last thing that happens when a function returns. You can stack as many as you want and they execute in the reverse order that they were declared. It looks something like this:
```go
func myFunction(intArg int, stringArg string) (int, error) {
	networkConn := openNetworkConnection()
	defer networkConn.Close()
	if intArg < 0 {
		errMsg := fmt.Sprintf("myFunction can only deal with positive integers, invalid argument: %v", intArg)
		return 0, errors.New(errMsg) // right after this, your deferred networkConn.Close() will execute
	}
	return intArg, nil // right after this, your deferred networkConn.Close() will execute
}
```
However, there's a complication. If the function you name in your defer statement takes arguments, and if those arguments are the return values of other functions, the argument-functions execute at the time you declare the defer, and the deferred function itself executes at function exit:
```go
func myFunction(intArg int, stringArg string) (int, error) {
	networkConn := openNetworkConnection()
	//determineHowConnShouldBeClosed() executes NOW, its return-value is stored as an
	// argument to closeMyNetworkConnection when it finally gets run.
	defer closeMyNetworkConnection(networkConn, determineHowConnShouldBeClosed())
	if intArg < 0 {
		errMsg := fmt.Sprintf("myFunction can only deal with positive integers, invalid argument: %v", intArg)
		return 0, errors.New(errMsg) // right after this, your deferred networkConn.Close() will execute
	}
	return intArg, nil // right after this, your deferred networkConn.Close() will execute
}
```

**Interfaces are always pointers**: Consider the following example:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Fooer interface {
	Foo() int
}

type ImplementsFooer struct{
	DataMember int
}

// provide the function foo to make your ImplementsFooer struct
// implement Fooer. Note that this function has a non-pointer
// receiver to an ImplementsFooer instance, we'll get to that
// later
func (f ImplementsFooer) Foo() int {
	return f.DataMember
}

func WantsPointerToFooer(f *Fooer) {
	fmt.Printf("I got a fooer, result of Foo() is %v\n", f.Foo())
}

func main(){
	var myInstance Fooer // declare as type Fooer
	myInstance = ImplementsFooer{DataMember: 5}
	WantsPointerToFooer(&myInstance)
}
```
It doesn't compile: *prog.go:24: f.Foo undefined (type *Fooer is pointer to interface, not interface).* This is because *myInstance* is of type interface, which is already a pointer. *WantsPointerToFooer* should actually accept *(f Fooer)* and you'll still get the pass-by-reference performance you're looking for.

**Pointer recievers, non-pointer receivers and the implementation of interfaces**

As you program your way through some of your first go projects, you'll likely discover, as I did, that you can add instance-methods to structs. In this way, you can get some object-like stuff going on. You might do it like this in python:
```python
class Foo:
    data_member = 1
    def increment_data_member(self):
        self.data_member += 1
```
and in Go, it looks like this:
```go
type Foo struct {
	DataMember int
}
func (f *Foo) IncrementDataMember() {
	f.DataMember++
}
```

Notice that the method, IncrementDataMember is made a "part" of the Foo struct with the "reciever" between the *func* and the *IncremenentDataMember*? That receiver is a pointer-receiver and if you're like me, you just internalized that as the way things are, but it goes a little deeper.

Pointers and the base type they point to have distinct method sets in Go, and this affects how you implement an interface. Let's use our implementation of the `Fooer` interface in the previous example:

```go
type Fooer interface {
  Foo() int
}

type ImplementsFooer struct{
  DataMember int
}

// this receiver is NOT a pointer
func (f ImplementsFooer) Foo() int {
  return f.DataMember
}
```

`ImplementsFooer` and the pointer to that type, `*ImplementsFooer` are _distinct types_ in Go, and in this example only one of them implements the `Fooer` interface.

Given that information, please look at this sample program:

```go
package main
import "fmt"

type Fooer interface {
  Foo() int
}

type ImplementsFooer struct{
  DataMember int
}

// implement the Fooer interface
func (f *ImplementsFooer) Foo() int {
  return f.DataMember
}

func main() {
  implFoo := ImplementsFooer{35}
  printFoo(implFoo)
}

// this function requires a 
// type that implements Fooer
func printFoo(f Fooer) {
  fmt.Println(f.Foo())
}
```

This program will not compile. The compiler will give you an error when you try to compile it:

```
cannot use implFoo (type ImplementsFooer) as type Fooer in argument to printFoo:
  ImplementsFooer does not implement Fooer (Foo method has pointer receiver)
```

In this case, the `*ImplementsFooer` type implements the interface, but the `ImplementsFooer` type does not â€“ structs and a pointer to that struct are have two distinct method sets in Go.

The simple fix for this example program is to pass a pointer into the `printFoo` function, like so:

```go
func main() {
  implFoo := ImplementsFooer{35}
  printFoo(&implFoo)
}
```

**The := symbol**: It's not an emoticon it's an assignment operator that automatically infers the type. In this way:
```go
var foo int
foo = 5
```
is equivalent to:
```go
foo := 5
```
but if you're not careful, it can mess with your scoping:
```go
foo, err := someFunction() // in this case, err is nil
if true {
	bar, err := someOtherFunction() // in this case, err is not nil, but it will
                                        // go out of scope at the end of the block
}
// out here, we're dealing with the original (nil) declaration of err
if err != nil {
	fmt.Printf("we had an error")
}
```
(this prints nothing)

if you find yourself writing something like that, you probably meant this instead:
```go
foo, err := someFunction() // err is nil
if true {
	var bar int
	bar, err = someOtherFunction() //err is not nill
}
if err != nil {
	fmt.Printf("we had an error")
}
```
(this prints we had an error)

**Pointers** Pointers are always a tripping hazard for new developers, and Go is no exception. Instead of re-inventing that blog, I recommend you just go read this: https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/8

**The Go compiler is more picky about style than other languages you may have worked with**: I don't have much concrete advice here, but it's something that bugged me when I started. If you're someone who likes your curly brackets ({) on the next line, that's a compile error, and you just have to learn to live with it. Fortunately, there's an automatic formatter called "fmt" that fixes everything for you. On the commandline, run: _go fmt_ and it will fix the formatting in all of your go files.

---
**Same-line statements are possible but they can get confusing for scope reasons**: Go allows you to put multiple statements on the same line separated by semi-colons. I haven't seen this often, but there are a couple of cases where I do. You can use it to check to see if something is in a map:
```go
myMap := make(map[string]string)
myMap["foo"] = "bar"
if value, ok := myMap["baz"]; !ok {
	// the "truthiness" of this if statement is in the last (right-most) statement
	fmt.Printf("baz does not seem to be in myMap\n")
} else {
	fmt.Printf("we found baz, its value is %v\n", value)
}
// be aware that value is not defined in this scope, outside the if/else block
```
And this will check to see if an operation returned an error:
```go
if result, err := someFunction(); err != nil {
	fmt.Printf("had a problem running someFunction. It returned a value of %v and an error, %v\n", result, err.Error())
}
// be aware that because result is declared inside an if-statement, it is not in scope outside the if-block.
```
---
**Postfix Increments**: They're statements, not operators as they are in other languages. fmt.Printf("%v\n", foo++) doesn't work.

---
** Range operator doesn't do exactly what I expected**: It seems to give you a strange, quasi-pointer, not a real reference. Take this example:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	mySlice := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
	myChan := make(chan *int, 10)

	for _, theInt := range mySlice {
		fmt.Printf("putting a pointer to %v on the chan\n", theInt)
		myChan <- &theInt
	}

	for i := 1; i <= 10; i++ {
		thePtr := <-myChan
		if *thePtr != i {
			fmt.Printf("pulled %v off the chan, expected %v\n", *thePtr, i)
		}
	}
}
```
You might expect it to put each of the members of the mySlice slice on the channel, but it doesn't. The output is:
```
putting a pointer to 1 on the chan
putting a pointer to 2 on the chan
putting a pointer to 3 on the chan
putting a pointer to 4 on the chan
putting a pointer to 5 on the chan
putting a pointer to 6 on the chan
putting a pointer to 7 on the chan
putting a pointer to 8 on the chan
putting a pointer to 9 on the chan
putting a pointer to 10 on the chan
pulled 10 off the chan, expected 1
pulled 10 off the chan, expected 2
pulled 10 off the chan, expected 3
pulled 10 off the chan, expected 4
pulled 10 off the chan, expected 5
pulled 10 off the chan, expected 6
pulled 10 off the chan, expected 7
pulled 10 off the chan, expected 8
pulled 10 off the chan, expected 9
```
So theInt, as defined in that range object, is safe to work with inside the scope of the for statement, but pointers to it seem to change later. So for a use case like this, it's safer simply to iterate:
```go
for i := 0; i < len(mySlice); i++ {
	myChan <- &mySlice[i]
}
``
